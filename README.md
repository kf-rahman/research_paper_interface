This project is a result of my pure laziness to find the most recent Deep Learning white papers. This is an one stop platform for me to come every morning and keep up with the latest research in my field of interest. Due to the motivation of this project A LOT  of bad practices were overlooked. As a fairly new full stack developer this was pretty fun to put together.

If you do end up using please do let me know as that will motivate me to work on it and improve it. Feedback is always appreaciated :)
